Feature Sets
============

The following subsections give a small conceptional introduction into the different feature sets of pflacco.
This section is highly derivative of the work of Prof. Dr. Pascal Kerschke who graciously agreed to provide most of textual and visual content in this section.

The technical documentation of the feature sets below can be found in the :doc:`api` section.
